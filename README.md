# 1. Defining the Question


# a) Specifying the Data Analysis Question

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. In this challenge, you have been tasked to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). You will be required to perform feature engineering then tune your most accurate model.


#b) Defining the Metric for Success

We will use the accuracy score as a metric for our success with 80% as success.


# c) Understanding the Context

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
